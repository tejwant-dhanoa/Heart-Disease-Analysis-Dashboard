# 🫀 Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides a detailed analysis of a heart disease dataset, focusing on survival statistics, age-based trends, and the impact of risk factors such as smoking, high blood pressure, anaemia, and diabetes.

## 📌 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to explore patient data to:
- Understand survival rates across different age groups.
- Analyze clinical factors (e.g., serum creatinine, ejection fraction) and their relationship with survival.
- Assess the influence of lifestyle and health conditions on heart disease outcomes.

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

This dashboard was developed while I was learning Power BI through various YouTube tutorials. I created it to test and demonstrate the progress I had made in understanding data modeling, DAX, and data visualization techniques. It serves as both a learning milestone and a practical project.
